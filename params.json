Said file is included.\r\n\r\n## The Technical Stuff\r\n\r\n- JIRA: version 6.4.8 x64\r\n- MySQL: Latest\r\n- Ports (internal/external): 8080:80\r\n- The manual step of installing the JDBC driver for MySQL is included.\r\n- Added VIM, curl, and some python to the mix to be safe.\r\n- RAM: 2GB\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy\r\n\r\nThere is an issue surrounding Apache not starting up fast enough after the inital installation is complete which may cause the Vagrant output to display an error. This won't matter too much as we manually stop and re-start JIRA after copying over the MySQL driver.\r\nIf you find yourself not being able to get past that issue, file an issue in this repo and I'll take a look. \r\n\r\nI tried this setup with 1GB and the 1.5GB and there wasn't enough ram for Tomcat to run properly. 2GB seems to work well enough for 2000 issues across a half-dozen projects. Your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT license is in effect here. Do with this repo whatever you wish. Fork the hell out of it and make it awesome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
